# T3-SankySounds

Sanky Sounds is a plugin made for Counter Strike 2 using [**CounterStrikesSharp**](https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp) to play custom sounds from chat.

# How to add custom sounds?
 To add custom sounds you need to go in config:
```json
    "SayPrefixes": [ // the prefixes player needs to type sounds with.
      ".",
      "!"
    ],
  "SankySounds": {
    "Sounds": {
      "amo, amo1": "sounds/mvp_manele/100_volume/amo.vsnd_c" // you can assing more keys to one sound, for example this sound can be played with .amo and .amo1
    }
  },
```

# How to use the volume for sounds?
 If you want to have volume for sounds you need to use this [VolumeAdjuster](https://github.com/oqyh/Volume-Adjuster-GoldKingZ) and create sounds with 20,40,60,80,100 volume as you want.
 Just read what in-app says and you will get it.
